#Week 1

[Hour reporting](https://github.com/saskeli/NonogramSolver_TiRa/blob/master/Documentation/Hour_reporting.md)

##What has happened during week 1

* Project creation
* Version control setup
* Some class creating
* Work on string parser (nonogram from definign string)
* Broad strokes design

Most of the time spent this week (as you'll be able to see in the hour reporting) 
has been spent on considering the structural design. The idea is to avoid major structural
changes as the project progresses.

##Problems

It took way too long to think of the generic solver design since I somehow got hung up on how to later 
implement threading functionality.

Also writing parsers is boring.

##Questions

Are nullable primals ("int?" "bool?") considered datastructures for the purposes of this course. I.E. Do I need to write my own nullable primals?

##Next week

A lot of coding and creating a rough class diagram/outline.

Ideally have a working (very bad) nonogram solver. Hopefully able to solve trivial nonograms.
