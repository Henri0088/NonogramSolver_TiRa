#Week 2

[Hour reporting](https://github.com/saskeli/NonogramSolver_TiRa/blob/master/Documentation/Hour_reporting.md)

## Progress

Week 4 course goals:

* Documentation - All code written has c# xml documentation.
* Progress on program - very bad solver done, started work on other solver.
* Testing - See testing

##Testing

[Test coverage] (https://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/saska/Coverage/ListInitTest.html)

I uploaded the test coverage report outside of github so it can be more readily browsed without downloading.

##What has happened during week 4


Generally loads of research and thinking. I think I've figured out how I want to implement the other solvers and possibly how some optimizing of the last resort treeSolver could be done. Very little coding tho. Some work on data structure and a little solver work.

##Problems

Who knew designing algorithms for solving NP complete problems was hard?

##What I learned this week

Recursions make my head hurt. The optimization of the treeSolver should include weird nested recursions.

##Next week

Same as last week and the week before. Hopefully start getting some real coding done.

* More solvers
* Optimize current TreeSolver a bit
* Keep documentation up to date
